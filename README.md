Lual? Language

Kids have very little interaction with teachers, 1 teacher per 50? students

Huge surge in Mobile phones, nearly 100% of adults have mobiles

Low cost android phones

### What they need is an android app for TEACHERS / Parents similar to teachers

* Recieve reports based on how studetns are doing

It triples or quadruples their impact when adults are involved.
